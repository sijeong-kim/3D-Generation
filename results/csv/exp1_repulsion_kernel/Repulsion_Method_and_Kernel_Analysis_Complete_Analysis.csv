# COMPLETE REPULSION AND KERNEL ANALYSIS - METHODOLOGY
# This file contains complete analysis of all method+kernel combinations
# 
# Analysis Details:
# - Parameters analyzed: repulsion method (RLSD/SVGD) + kernel type (COS/RBF)
# - Method: First averaged over prompts, then grouped by method+kernel combination
# - Metrics calculated: Mean, standard deviation, min, max, coefficient of variation
# - Grouping: By method and kernel combination
# - Total combinations: 4
# 
# Each row represents the aggregated performance for a specific method+kernel combination
# Statistics are calculated across all seeds and prompts for that combination
#
