# KERNEL TYPE COMPARISON - METHODOLOGY
# This file compares COS vs RBF kernel types
# 
# Analysis Details:
# - Parameter analyzed: kernel type (COS vs RBF)
# - Method: First averaged over prompts, then averaged over repulsion methods
# - Metrics calculated: Mean, standard deviation, min, max, coefficient of variation
# - Grouping: By kernel type
# - Total kernel combinations: 2
# 
# Each row represents the aggregated performance for a specific kernel type
# Statistics are calculated across all seeds, prompts, and repulsion methods for that kernel
