# REPULSION METHOD COMPARISON - METHODOLOGY
# This file compares RLSD vs SVGD repulsion methods
# 
# Analysis Details:
# - Parameter analyzed: repulsion method (RLSD vs SVGD)
# - Method: First averaged over prompts, then averaged over kernels
# - Metrics calculated: Mean, standard deviation, min, max, coefficient of variation
# - Grouping: By repulsion method type
# - Total method combinations: 2
# 
# Each row represents the aggregated performance for a specific repulsion method
# Statistics are calculated across all seeds, prompts, and kernel types for that method
