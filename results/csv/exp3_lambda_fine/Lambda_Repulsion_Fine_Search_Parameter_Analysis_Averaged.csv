# AVERAGED DATA - METHODOLOGY
# This file contains data averaged over prompts for easier comparison
# 
# Averaging Details:
# - Method: Mean across all prompts for each parameter combination
# - Total prompts included: 4
# - Prompts: a bulldozer made out of toy bricks, a photo of a tulip, a photo of an ice cream, a small saguaro cactus planted in a clay pot
# - Original data points: 20
# - Averaged data points: 5
# 
# Each row represents the average performance across all prompts for a specific parameter value
# Standard deviations and other statistics are also averaged accordingly
